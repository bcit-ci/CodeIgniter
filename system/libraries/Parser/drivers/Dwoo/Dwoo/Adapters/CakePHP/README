// CakePHP Dwoo bridge  -  v0.2 
// ------------------------
// Installation :
// ------------------------
// 1. Download and install the dwoo library, preferably on the
// 'vendors' directory of CakePHP. However you can place it
// anywhere you want; if you do, make sure to change the App::import
// line in dwoo.php to include the dwoo library properly.
//
// 2. Place this file in the  app/views directory, or on cake/libs/view.
// 
// 3. Create the app/tmp/dwoo/cache and app/tmp/dwoo/compile directories 
// and make sure they are writable.
// ------------------------
// Usage example :
// ------------------------

// In your controller class you need to change the view property to
// use Dwoo at some point in the execution using :

$this->view = 'Dwoo';

// Or you can also override the view property in your AppController class as such :

class AppController extends Controller {
    public $view = 'Dwoo';
}

// If you want another template extension (default is .tpl) you must
// edit the dwoo.php file at line 44 and change it to :
$this->ext = ".html";

//{include $templatedir."index.tpl"}
