<ul>
<li>Updated plugins, helpers, and language classes to allow your "application" folder to contain its own plugins, helpers, and language folders.

<li>Added some code to allow email attachments to be reset when sending batches of email.</li>
<li>Deprecated the following database functions: $this->db->smart_escape_str() and $this->db->fields().</li>

<ul>
<li>Added a <a href="../libraries/unit_testing.html">Unit Testing Library</a>.</li>
<li>Added the ability to pass objects to the <strong>insert()</strong> and <strong>update()</strong>  database functions.

<h2>Version 1.3</h2>
<p>Release Date: April 3, 2006</p>

<ul>
<li>Added support for <a href="models.html">Models</a>.</li>
<li>Redesigned the database libraries to support additional RDBMs (Postgre, MySQLi, etc.).</li>
<li>Redesigned the <a href="../libraries/database/active_record.html">Active Record class</a> to enable more varied types of queries with simpler syntax, and advanced features like JOINs.</li>
<li>Added a feature to the database class that lets you run <a href="../libraries/database/call_function.html">custom function calls</a>.</li>
<li>Added support for <a href="controllers.html">private functions</a> in your controllers.  Any controller function name that starts with an underscore will not be served by a URI request.</li>
<li>Added the ability to pass your own initialization parameters to your <a href="creating_libraries.html">custom core libraries</a> when using $this->load->library()</li>
<li>Added support for running standard <a href="urls.html">query string URLs</a>.  These can be optionally enabled in your config file.</li>
<li>Added the ability to  <a href="urls.html">specify a "suffix"</a>, which will be appended to your URLs.  For example, you could add .html to your URLs, making them appear static. This feature is enabled in your config file.</li>
<li>Added a new error template for use with native PHP errors.</li>

<li>Removed slashing from the input class. After much debate we decided to kill this feature.</li>
<li>Change the commenting style in the scripts to the PEAR standard so that IDEs and tools like phpDocumenter can harvest the comments.</li>
<li>Added better class and function name-spacing to avoid collisions with user developed classes. All Code Igniter classes are now prefixed with <dfn>CI_</dfn> and
all controller methods are prefixed with <dfn>_ci</dfn> to avoid controller collisions. A list of reserved function names can be <a href="controllers.html">found here</a>.</li>
<li>Redesigned how the "CI" super object is referenced, depending on whether PHP 4 or 5 is being run, since PHP 5 allows a more graceful way to manage objects that utilizes a bit less resources.</li>
<li>Deprecated: <var>$this->db->use_table()</var> has been deprecated. Please read the <a href="../libraries/database/active_record.html">Active Record</a> page for information.</li>
<li>Deprecated: <var>$this->db->smart_escape_str()</var> has been deprecated. Please use this instead: <var>$this->db->escape()</var></li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the exception handler which was preventing some PHP errors from showing up.</li>
<li>Fixed a typo in the URI class.  $this->total_segment() should be plural: $this->total_segments()</li>
<li>Fixed some typos in the default calendar template</li>
<li>Fixed some typos in the user guide</li>
</ul>








<h2>Version 1.2</h2>

<ul>

<li>Added a global function named <a href="ancillary_classes.html">get_instance()</a> allowing the main Code Igniter object to be accessible throughout your own classes.</li>
<li>Added new <a href="../helpers/file_helper.html">File Helper</a>:  delete_files()</li>
